Overview: A framework to reduce communication overhead between human operators and robotic swarms by ~79% using event-triggered control.

Core Components: Recursive Newton-Euler dynamics proxy, Girard stability buffer, and adaptive thresholds.

Reproducibility: Instructions to run the Monte Carlo simulation (N=100) to verify the results reported in the manuscript.
